# Contributing guide

Thank you for your help in making RSE better!

Please note the project is currently in slow-maintenance mode until the end of 2023.


### Development

Unfortunately, there is no proper development environment setup.

Back in v0.1, the setup involved using storybook:

```bash
npm install
npm run storybook
```
Nowadays, this will most likely throw some errors.
You're better off creating an environment of your own.
